/* 
Data Definition Language - Truncate Statement
-------------------------------------------
The result of this operation quickly removes all data from a table, typically bypassing a number of integrity enforcing mechanisms.
Truncate operations drop and re-create the table, which is much faster than deleting rows one by one, particularly for large tables.
Truncation operations do not return a meaningful value for the number of deleted rows. 
The usual result is “0 rows affected,” which should be interpreted as “no information.”
